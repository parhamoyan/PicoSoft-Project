The UI is designed by pro UI/UX designer [Sina Nouri](https://www.instagram.com/sinanouriux/) and implemented by me.
## The history of this project:
I'm really interested in designing and implementing the modern user interfaces. 2 weeks ago, i was on instagram and i was looking for some UI inspirations and suddenly, i found a great dark-theme UI designed by Sina ([click here to see the instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQNDwlNj6cp/)). I told myself that i'm not yet a UI designer but i'm already a programmer. So i decided to implement this UI in Python and with PySide Module to challenge myself and prepare something for my CV. I redesigned the icons with adobe illustrator. I hope this project will help anyone who is willing to learn PySide/PyQt module and also helps me to find a job.

## Attention !
This is not a commercial project. You are free to use it only in your none-commercial projects. There are 2 problems and i'm working on. I have to implement a custom QLineEdit because the stylesheet is not enough and also, the calendar is not responsive. Now i'm busy. I will fix it in 2 3 days.
