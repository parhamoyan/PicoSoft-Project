# PicoSoft Project
The UI is designed by a pro UI/UX designer Sina Nouri and implemented by me.
The history of this project:
I'm really interested in designing and implementing the modern user interfaces. 2 weeks ago, i was on instagram and i was looking for some UI inspirations and suddenly, i found a great dark-theme UI designed by Sina. I told my-self that i'm not yet a UI designer but i'm already a programmer. So i decided to implement this UI in Python and with PySide Module to challenge my-self and prepare something for my CV. I hope this project will help anyone who is wheeling to learn PySide/PyQt module and also helps me to find a job.
